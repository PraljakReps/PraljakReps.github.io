Launched research project: "Discovering the Design Rules Linking Protein Sequence to Function". This study utilizes and develops advanced multi-modal generative AI models to map the relationship between protein sequences and their functions, aiming to enable the design of novel proteins with desired properties (see [link](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/discovering-the-design-rules-linking-protein-sequence-to-function/)).
